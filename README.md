- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @w1l3yc0y0t3
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in, well let's not get into that just yet...
- 
- Iâ€™m currently ğŸ§  teaching myself how to code and use github in general.
- I started out on ğŸ–¥ windows but now I am using a ğŸ’» chromebook. My first ever linux system.
- The learning curve is steep to say the least. But,
- I'm ğŸ˜  relentless in my pursuit of complete freedom from elite doctrine. And most likely
- more than a little ğŸ¤ª crazy!!
-
- Y'all don't want me on a collab, I would just slow you down. BUt any tips or tricks that might
- help me from banging my head against the wall I would gladly appreciate.
-
- ğŸ“« Feel free to reach out on here and say hi. I've never met a stranger
